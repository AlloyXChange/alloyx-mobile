# Investor Interface for AlloyX

## Summary

AlloyX locks together tokenized bonds issued on Ethereum and emits ETF tokens on Celo, a mobile first low-cost EVM chain. AlloyX ETF tokens are deployed on liquidity pools, support fractional staking and provide low transaction costs to create liquid markets for KYCed investors seeking fairly priced institutional grade investment opportunities.

Investors can invest in AlloyX ETF tokens to earn payments in stable coins on a regular schedule. They seek liquid institutional grade investments into a high yield asset un-correlated with Bitcoin that also earn them rewards in utility tokens.

## AlloyX Mobile

This repository contains the frontend for the investor experience. We have integrated with @celo-tools/use-contractkit to enable wallet access. From this interface, investors can browse and purchase Pooled Investments on the Celo network.
